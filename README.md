Task 1: Data Profiling using Alteryx
In this task, data profiling was performed using Alteryx. The screenshots of the completed data profiling process are included in the "Screenshots" folder. Additionally, the time taken for each profiling job is documented in the "Profiling Time" file. The Alteryx workflow for data profiling is available as a completed job file.
Task 2: Loading Data into Staging Tables with Talend
This task involved loading data into staging tables using Talend. The screenshots of the completed loading jobs can be found in the "Loading Screenshots" folder. The completed Talend job files are also included in the repository. A list of tables along with their row counts is available in the "stg_tables_RowCount" file.
Task 3: Preliminary Dimensional Model
In this task, a preliminary dimensional model was created. The facts and dimensions for the model are listed in the "Facts and Dimensions" document.
Additional Information
The repository also contains documentation on how to develop the data model, including source systems analysis, data profiling, data consistency and quality examination, and mapping of source tables and columns to integration tables. After loading the data from the staging tables to the dimensional model, data cleansing tasks were performed using Talend.
